# Numpy_random_assignment-2018

This repository cover numpy.random package in Python, Jupyter notebook is used to explain the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

This is an assignment which is part of my course work for Programming for Data Analysis Module. The module is taught to graduates of Level 8 studying for Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics) with GMIT in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Dr. Ian McLoughlin.

For this assignment below was covered:
>1.	Overall purpose of numpy.random package.
>2.	Use of “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
>3.	Use of and purpose of five “Distributions” functions.
>4.	Use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Summary 
Python programming language will be used for this assignment. Python is a great general-purpose programming language and with the help of popular libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib it is an established powerful programming language for scientific computing.

Numpy is one of the core library for scientific computing in Python, NumPy was originally developed in the mid-2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric [1]. it is well-known for delivering a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It offers a great alternative to Python lists, as NumPy arrays are more compact allowing faster access in reading and writing items, and are more convenient and more efficient overall because of this NumPy arrays are often preferred over Python lists.

Random is a module which generates pseudo-random numbers, other module functions depend on the function random() to generate random numbers from different distributions depending on the function called within the random module.  Random module contains very useful functions and will be covered in …….(put link).

Numpy.random, the package for the purpose of this assignment in simple language that numpy is used basically for creating an array while random generate random values from what I gathered through lectures and extra research. In one sentence it is a package used for creating an array where each element is a random number.

For the purpose of this assignment bar chart, histogram, boxplots, scatter plots and so on will be used for examples demonstration and Descriptive Statistics Using Numpy.Random will be covered for illustration purpose.
